## Important Notes

- This setup uses a single NAT instance which could be a single point of failure
- For production environments, consider using AWS NAT Gateway or implementing auto-scaling NAT instances
- The t2.micro instance type is used for demonstration; choose an appropriate instance type based on your traffic needs


## Cost Considerations

This solution uses a NAT Instance instead of a NAT Gateway, which can be more cost-effective for development or low-traffic environments. However, consider the following:

- EC2 instance costs (hourly rate)
- Data transfer costs
- EBS volume costs

## Security Considerations

- The NAT instance security group allows all outbound traffic
- Only VPC CIDR range can access the NAT instance
- Private subnets have no direct internet access
- All traffic is routed through the NAT instance

## Limitations

- Single point of failure (no high availability)
- Performance limited by EC2 instance type
- Manual updates required for the NAT instance
